  <description>&lt;color=#7c0a02&gt;There can be only one!&lt;/color&gt;
-Level This! introduces staggering new gameplay by introducing a Health levelling system, start as a Level 0 Colonist and work your way up to the doomsday launcher absorbing Level 100 Pirate Boss!
  
  
  
Joking aside, this mod allows pawns to level up depending on their damage taken. The damage requirement and the gains for each level are compounding by different rates to guarantee a certain balance.

Please please please thank Ziehn#6439 for the amazing art!
